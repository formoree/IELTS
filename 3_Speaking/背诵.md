1. job
   1. **After high school, I happened to watch a short film about life in the future. In the short film, people can see the projected interactive interface, and at the same time, they can use their fingers to interact in the interactive interface and give instructions to machines such as refrigerators. This is almost my dream life. Most of the technologies to realize such scenarios are related to computers, so I chose to major in computer science when I was an undergraduate, and I hope to be a programmer to realize these scenarios after graduation.**
2. one competition
   1. The last contest I entered was a presentation on your dream career. In the speech, I mentioned that after high school I happened to watch a short film about life in the future. In the short film, people can see the projected interactive interface, and at the same time, they can use their fingers to interact in the interactive interface and give instructions to machines such as refrigerators. In order to realize this scenarios,I dreamed of being a programmer.It was my first time to participate in resentation competition,so I worked very hard for that.You know I spent almost 10 hours a day .Eventually, I won the second prize,as it requires some knowledge and skills that I still need time to learn and improve,but I am quite happy with my "consolation prize",as I worked really hard and delivered a wonderful speech to win it.
3. Being late
   1. I have been late for class or bus, but there is one time that I will always remember, you know,that I was late for a competition. I was preparing for the presentation the night before and went to sleep very late, so when I got woke up by the phone call from my friend 5 minutes before the competition,you can imagine how anxious I was. She was like:“WHERE ARE YOU? The competition is going to start at any second now!” So I rushed to the venue without washing my faceor brushing my teeth. What a mess! But I had confidence about my presentation, as I worked really hard for it,and it was a success, despite of my crazy hairstyle.
4. language
   1. Besides Mandarin, English is the second language I have been exposed to the most, and it is also the language I think is the most convenient. Information will change its original meaning in multiple transmissions, so I prefer to learn about international affairs on foreign websites. And mastering English can get the information I want to know more quickly and effectively for me.
5. game
   1. I like playing Super Mario the most. In the game, I can use my ingenuity to help the protagonist reach the finish line. But when I was a kid, I didn't have that much time to play games, so I never got Mario to the finish line. I didn't beat the game until after high school. After passing, first there is joy, followed by emptiness. Because I found that Mario is like ourselves, making the best decision in a given situation, but our life seems to have no end.

1. wedding
   1. What I remember most is my sister's wedding. First, I received an invitation letter with a photo of my sister and her husband on it. They were wearing Tang suits and smiling very happily. I came to my sister's city a few days early to help her choose the cake, arrange the wedding and so on. After the wedding, we also had a musical dinner where everyone sang and danced on the dance floor. I sang Taylor Swift's love story to my sister and brother-in-law, and at the same time wished them a happy wedding. Such a scene is unforgettable.

My favorite exercise is just hanging out in the wild, which might be called wildwalk now. We may spend hours climbing a very low mountain. We are not for competitions, but for getting close to nature, breathing fresh air, and being able to meet animals that cannot be seen in the city. In this process, exercise your body and relieve the tiredness caused by work.I really think it is important to keep close to the nature and animals,and that's why I always enjoy the daylight in the afternoon,you know,as it is so bright and warm.Just imagine,if you see a wild animal ,such as a horse,running on the grassland,you will feel free and relaxed as well.I enjoy that feeling so much.

Many people think that physics is unrealistic and impractical.Well, they really shouldn't be blamed for that, as the method of teaching science subjects in China is basically repeating and memorizing things from the textbooks and guidance books. They are full of numbers and rules and really hard to be fond of.Well,the answer could be yes if you are a geek,but who else would have the heart for those kinds of things,right?

Although physics is formed by concepts,rules and methodologies, you know, all about data and constant, our society really relays on it, not only when it comes to finding a better way to design faster cars or having a more advanced touch screen for iPads, but also how it works on the spiritual level. Most scientists devote their time, energy, sometimes even life to make a point to the world. They care about the truth,and their perseverance is what I admire the most.

(尽管物理学是由概念、规则和方法论构成的，但你知道，一切都与数据和常数有关，但我们的社会确实依赖它，不仅是在寻找更好的方法来设计更快的汽车或为 iPad 配备更先进的触摸屏时，而且在精神层面上也是如此。 大多数科学家投入时间、精力，有时甚至是生命来向世界阐明观点。 他们关心真理，他们的毅力是我最佩服的。)

With the instruction of our physics teacher, we were divided into small groups and asked to find material that maybe helpful. In that case,we had to work within the group and tried to find out the best way to present and redo the experiment that we were assigned to. Despite of the unfamiliarity,we were actually kind of looking forward to it, you know, as we would hnave a chance to do something on our own rather than sit in the classroom and listen.(在物理老师的指导下，我们被分成小组，并要求寻找可能有用的材料。 在这种情况下，我们必须在小组内工作，并试图找出展示和重做分配给我们的实验的最佳方式。 尽管不熟悉，我们实际上还是有点期待，你知道，因为我们有机会自己做一些事情，而不是坐在教室里听。)
