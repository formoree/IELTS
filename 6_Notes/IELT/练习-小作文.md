####  Loss in generation of electricity of brown coal
【25mins 8.22】**6**
The flow diagram illustrates the process of generation of electricity from coal and the amount of energy lost in this process from different two kinds of coal. Overall, the Electricity generation processes from brown coal and black coal involve the same four steps, but the later one generates more energy.
To begin with, coal is transported by trucks to the power stations, where the coal is then transformed into electricity. We assume that 100 units energy contained by coal have been taken to the power station. There are 70 units energy lost in the transformation from brown coal to electricity, and 30% of the initial input energy is transported and distributed by power towers to consumers. Finally, consumers may abtain 27 units energy from brown coal for 3 units energy have been lost in transportation process. As for black coal, there are fewer losses in transformation process, with 68 units. And the loss of tranportation is the same as that of brown coal, thus consumers attain more energy comparing to brown coal.
In summary, the process of generation of electricity of coal commences with raw coal transportation, culminates in Electricity consumption of users. Black coal is a kind of more valuble material comparing to brown one.

The flow diagram illustrates the process of generating electricity from two types of coal—brown coal and black coal—and the amount of energy lost in each process.【from two different kinds of 应该放到前面来】 Overall, while both processes involve the same four steps, black coal proves to be more efficient, resulting in higher energy output.【while 保证逻辑顺畅；both precesses 指代正确；efficient 给出主观评价；】
The process begins with trucks transporting coal to power stations, where it is converted into electricity. Starting with 100 units of energy input for both types of coal, significant differences emerge in the transformation stage.【这里提前说明有不同】 For brown coal, 70 units are lost during conversion, **leaving** only 30 units for distribution. **After** a further loss of 3 units during transmission, consumers ultimately receive 27 units of energy from brown coal.【After 让行文更为流畅 27 units of energy 注意表达的规范】 In contrast, black coal demonstrates **greater efficiency**, with only 68 units lost during the transformation process. The transmission loss **remains constant** at 3 units, resulting in consumers receiving 29 units of energy from black coal - 2 units more than from brown coal.【细节阐述不到位，最终users会得到多少，少了多少都没有进行阐述】
In conclusion, while both processes follow **identical** steps from coal transportation to consumer usage, black coal proves to be a more **valuable resource**, **yielding** higher energy output and demonstrating greater efficiency in electricity generation compared to brown coal.【形容词的描述比较精确】

> average temperature throughout the year

The graphs illustrate how the average hours of sunshine and the average temperature change during the whole year in Melbourne and Darwin in Australia. Overall, the average temperature in Darwin keeps consistantly higher through the year than  that in Melbourne, while in most months of the year, Darwin has more average hours of  sunshine than Melbourne.
Starting at 18 of the average temperature, Darwin rises to the highest average temperature at 30 in eighth month and follows a decrease to the end at 21. The trend of average temperature in Melbourne has a same pattern of that of Darwin, however, Darwin is much hotter than Melbourne during the whole year. And Darwin begins at 6 in first month, rises to 18 in seventh month, following by a drop to the end.
As for daily sunshine time, Darwin starts at 6 hours, then soar untill the sixth month and keep stable in the following three months. After that, the hours of sunshine in Darwin drops to 8 hours till the end. In contrast, Melbourne shares the opposit pattern of that in Darwin. The daily hours of sunshine starts at 10, and then decreases to 6 till fifth month.Following unchanged for three months, the average hours utimately increase to 10 hours.
In summary, Darwin's average temperature is higher through the year, while the houres of sunshine in Melbourne and Darwin fluctuates between 6 to 10 hours.

The graphs illustrate how the average hours of sunshine and the average temperature change during the whole year in Melbourne and Darwin in Australia. Overall, Darwin **maintains** a consistently higher average temperature than Melbourne throughout the year.【对于temperature一般是用"remains consistently higher"或"stays consistently higher"】 Additionally, Darwin generally experiences more hours of sunshine than Melbourne in most months.
Darwin's average temperature **starts at** 18°C in January, peaks at 30°C in August, and then **decreases to** 21°C by December. Melbourne **follows a similar pattern but with lower temperatures**, starting at 6°C in January, rising to 18°C in July, and then **dropping back to** 6°C by December.
Regarding daily sunshine hours, Darwin **starts with** 6 hours in January, **increases steadily** until June, and **remains stable** for the next three months. After September, the sunshine hours **drop to** 8 hours by December. In contrast, Melbourne **starts with** 10 hours of sunshine in January, **decreases to** 6 hours by May, **remains unchanged** for three months, and then **increases back** to 10 hours by December.
In summary, Darwin's average temperature **remains higher** throughout the year, while the hours of sunshine in both Melbourne and Darwin **fluctuate between 6 and 10 hours**.
