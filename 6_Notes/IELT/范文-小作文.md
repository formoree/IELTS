**The flow diagram illustrates the eight-stage process involved in the manufacture of instant noodles.**
**To begin**, flour **is transported by** truck and **pumped into** storage silos. From there, it **is conveyed to** a mixing machine where it **is combined with** water and oil to produce a dough. This dough is **then** carefully pressed into sheets by rollers. These sheets are sliced into narrow strips using a cutting machine, forming the initial shape of the noodles. The noodle strips are **subsequently** molded into noodles discs.
**The next stage** **involves** cooking these noodle discs in a bath of oil, ensuring they attain the desired texture **before being left to** dry in an appropriate environment. **Once** dry, the noodle discs are placed into cups **along with** vegetables and spices. **Finally**, each cup **is meticulously labeled and sealed**, **thus completing the production cycle.**
**In summary**, the process **commences with** the storage and processing of raw flour and **culminates in** the packaging of ready-to-eat noodle cups, **characterized by** a sequence of intricate stages that ensure product quality.

>The stages in the recycling of aluminium drink cans
![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formoree/PicGO-Picture/master/202408211522134.png)

The flow chart illustrates the process of recycling discarded drink cans. Overall, this **cyclical** process **consists of approximately eight distinct stages**, **grouped into three main steps**: collection, manufacturing, and consumption.
In the initial phase of the process, discarded cans **are collected from** recycling bins and **sorted by** material, either aluminum or steel. The sorted cans **are placed in** separate containers and **transported by** trucks to a recycling factory **for further processing.**
At the factory, the first stage involves **compressing the delivered cans into blocks**. These blocks **are melted to form** aluminum ingots. **Subsequently**, these ingots **are used to** produce aluminum rolls, **serving as** raw material for manufacturing new cans of standard sizes. **Ultimately,** the newly recycled cans **are filled with** various types of drinks and **stocked in** **vending machines**. Once consumers purchase and consume the drinks, they discard the empty cans, thereby continuing the cycle.
In conclusion, **the recycling of drink cans is** a continuous, environmentally-friendly **process** **comprising** collection, manufacturing, and consumption. **By actively participating in this cycle**, **individuals contribute to sustainable waste management and resource conservation.**

>Cinema attendance rates by age group
1. 用all age cohorts代写percentages 或者rates

The line graph **illustrates** the proportion of people in four age groups attending movies at least once a month from 1978 to 2008. **All age groups showed a pattern of initial decline, followed by a rise and a slight decrease at the end.** The 14-24 age group consistently had the highest movie attendance, while the 50+ group had the lowest.
In 1978, the 14-24 age group **led with a 90% attendance rate**, which **fell to** 80% by 1988, **rebounded to** 90% in 1998, and then slightly **declined to** 80% in 2008. The 25-34 group also **began high** at 80%, **dropping to** 50% in 1988, and then **recovering to** nearly 80% by 2008. For the 35-49 group, attendance **started at** 60%, **declined to** 40% by 1988, **then rose to** 70% in 1998 **before ending at** 60%. The 50+ group consistently had the lowest rates, **starting at** 30%, **dropping to** 20% in 1988, and **increasing to** 40% by 2008. Notably, the 14-24 and 25-34 groups **reached similar levels** by 2008, despite differing paths.
In summary, while all age groups experienced fluctuations, the 14-24 group maintained the highest attendance, **whereas** the 50+ group had the lowest, **illustrating a shared trend of decline and recovery over the period.**

>Water usage in San Diego, California and the rest of the world

The pie charts compare how water is used in San Diego County, California and worldwide.
In detail, **residential water use** **makes up** three-fifths in San Diego; however, **this figure** **is significantly smaller for** California, at 39%. **The amount of water used in the industrial sector** in both areas **ranks second** with about a quarter and a third respectively. Interestingly, both San Diego and California are shown to use the least amount of water **for agricultural purposes**, **with corresponding figures of 17% and 28%.**
Worldwide water allocation, however, is remarkably different than that of San Diego County and California. Agricultural use of water around the globe **accounts for by far the highest figure**, with well over two-thirds. **In contrast, the figures for industrial and domestic water use are substantially smaller. The former constitutes 23%, which is nearly three times as much as that of the latter.**
**Overall,** while San Diego County and California use water mostly for residential purposes and least for agriculture, the reverse can be said of the worldwide usage of water.

> A small theater in 2010 and 2012

The maps illustrate the layout changes of a small theater between 2010 and 2012.  

In 2010, **the southern part of the theater** had a cafe **in the bottom right corner**, a ticket office in the bottom left corner, and an admin office **next to** it. **The upper section** included a stage in front of **the seating area**, with a storage room to the left and a dressing room behind the stage.  
By 2012, the ticket office **was relocated to** the bottom right corner, **replacing** the cafe, and the admin office **was moved further back**, **allowing for** a new restaurant **in the bottom left corner**. The stage **almost doubled in size**, and a side hall **was added behind it**. The storage room **was moved to** the opposite end of the stage, **making way for** a new showers area and the relocated dressing room. The old dressing room space **was converted into** a corridor connecting the new dressing room and storage room.  
**Overall, the theater expanded sideways, with significant reconfigurations, except for the central seating area, which remained unchanged.**
