**Traditionally**,children have begun studying foreign languages at secondary school, **but** introducing them earlier is recommended by some educationalists. This policy has been adopted by some educational authorities or individual schools, with both positive and negative outcomes.
**<u>The obvious argument in its favour</u> is that young children pick up languages much more easily than teenagers.** Their brains <u>are still programmed to</u> acquire their mother tongue,which <u>facilitates</u> learning another language, and unlike adolescents, they <u>are not inhibited by</u> self- consciousness.
**The greater flexibility of the primary timetable allows for more frequent, shorter sessions and for a play-centred approach,** thus maintaining learners' enthusiasm and progress. Their command of the language <u>in later life</u> will benefit from this early exposure, while learning other languages <u>subsequently</u> will be easier for them. They may also <u>gain a better understanding of other cultures.</u>
**There are,however, some disadvantages.** Primary school teachers are <u>generalists</u>, and may not have the necessary language skills themselves. If <u>specialists</u> have to be brought in to <u>deliver these sessions</u>, the flexibility referred to above is diminished. If primary language teaching is not standardised, secondary schools could be faced with a great variety of levels in different languages within their intake, resulting in a classroom experience which undoes the earlier gains. There is no advantage if enthusiastic primary pupils become demotivated as soon as they change schools.**However, these issues can be addressed strategically within the policy adopted.**
Anything which encourages language learning benefits society culturally and economically, and early exposure to language learning contributes to this. Young children's <u>innate abilities</u> should be <u>harnessed</u> to make these benefits more <u>achievable</u>.

It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school. <u>The trend is not restricted to rich students</u> who have the money to travel, <u>but is also evident among poorer students</u> who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time.

**The reasons for this trend mnay involve** **the recognition** that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is <u>rather</u> restricted <u>in terms of</u> general knowledge and experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or traveling to other places, <u>have a broader view of life</u> and <u>better personal resources to draw on</u>. They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of students life.

**However, there are certainly dangers** in taking time off at that important age. Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic environment. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course. **But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.**

Myl View is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with her lives and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this.

<u>ln current society</u>, schools <u>are regarded as</u> a place to guide children and protect them. At the same time, children in schools are often thought to be docile. However, they do not behavethemselves as well as we predict. **Personally speaking, multiple factors contribute to this phenomenon.**

**Firstly, education system is to blame.** To be specific, <u>exam oriented learning</u> gives priority to the classes related to tests, but ignores comprehensive development of a student. In addition,teachers only concentrate on the academic performance or the learning outcome <u>no matter what</u> methods students adopt to compete with others. **To deal with this problem,extra-curriculum should be introduced.** For example,sport is recommended in improving students'team work. Supposing students are allowed more opportunities to cooperate with their classmates, they would be more active and modest.

**Secondly, children nowadays <u>are obsessed with</u> materialistic values.** In their eyes, <u>the academic marks</u> are not as important as whether their clothes are fashionable enough. When they see a <u>voguish</u> cell phone in the advertisement, they think they have to follow the suit. Otherwise, theywould be mocked and even excluded by their classmates. **Efforts should be made by both parents and schools to <u>tackle this tendency</u>.** lt is not wise to encourage and reward children according to their marks in final exams. Besides, wearing uniform and eliminating anything irrelevant to learning in campus are also <u>acceptable strategies.</u>

**To sum up**, there are definitely many problems existing in schooling children and they are to young to behave themselves .**Fortunately,these problems can be addressed through attempts from family and teachers.**

<u>There is no doubt that</u> traffic and pollution from vehicles have become huge problems,both in cities and on motorways everywhere.**Solving these problems is likely to need more than a simple rise in the price of petrol.**

**While it is <u>undeniable</u> that private car use is one of the main causes of the increase intraffic and pollution**, higher fuel costs are unlikely to limit the number of drivers for long.As this policy would also affect the cost of public transport, it would be very unpopular with everyone who needs to travel on the roads.**But there are various other measures that could be implemented that would have a huge effect on these problems.**

**l think to tackle the problem of pollution, cleaner fuels need to be developed.** The technology is already available to produce electric cars that would be both quieter and cleaner to use.<u>Persuading</u> manufactures and travelers to <u>adopt this new technology</u> would be a more effective strategy for improving air quality, especially in cities.

However, traffic congestion will not be solved by changing the type of private vehicle people can use. **To do this, we need to improve the choice of public transport services available to travelers.** For example, if <u>sufficient</u> sky trains and underground train systems were built and effectively maintained <u>in our major cities</u>, then traffic on the roads would be <u>dramatically</u> reduced.Long-distance train and coach services should be made attractive and <u>affordable</u> alternatives to drive your own car for long journeys.

In conclusion, l think that long-term traffic and pollution reductions would <u>depend on</u> educating the public to use public transport more,and on governments using public money to construct and run efficient systems.

There are 3 main reasons involved in the chart.The largest part is **over-grazing**,which accounts for 35% and the second largest one is **deforestation**,constituting 30%,followed by **over-cultivation **,with 28%.Other factors that contribute to reduced productivity in agricultural land account for 7%.

（进阶版，将chart中的词进一步改写；副词数增多；连贯性更强）(represent）

65% of degration **is caused by** too much animal grazing and tree clearance, constituting 35% and 30% respectively.A further 28% of global degration **is due to** over-culivation of crops.Other causes **account for** only 7% collectively.

The given table **shows** the detaills **concerning** the underground railway systems in six cities.(简单扼要介绍背景)

London has the oldest underground railway system among the six cities,opened in the year 1863,**while** the tube in Los Angeles did not serve its citizens until the year 2001.Paris,Tokyo,Washington DC, and Kyoto all opened their systems in 20 century.（第一列）

**On the part of** the size of the railway systems,**London, as predicte, has the largest underground railway system(394 kilometers),which is nearly twice as large as that in Paris.**It seems that the earlier the subway was constructed,the longer its system is,except Kyoto, whose system was built in 1981 but with length of **only over** 10 kilometers.

**In terms of** passengeres served per year,the system in Tokyo is the most crowded  one because it only has 155 kilometers of route,but bears the largest number of passengers,at 1927 million passengers.There are substantial differences in each cities.Kyoto and Los Angeles take the small number of passengeers(45 and 50 million respectively).

**In conclusion, London constructed the earliest railway, with the largest length.But it is the system in Tokyo that serves the most number of passengers.**

The graph **illustrates** changes in the amounts of beef,lamb,chicken and fish consumed in a particular European country from 1979 to 2004.

(1979时间点 从大到小进行描写)

In 1979 beef was by far the most popular of these foods,<u>with</u> about 225 grams consumed per person per week. Lamb and chicken **were eaten** <u>in similar quantities</u> (around 150 grams),while much less fish was consumed(**just over** 50 grams).

However, during this 25-year period the consumption of beef and lamb fell **dramatically** to approximately 100 grams and 55 grams respectively.The consumption of fish also declined, but **much less significantly** to just below 50 grams,so although it remained the least popular food,consumption level was the most <u>stable</u>.

The consumption of chicken, on the other hand, showed an upward trend, overtaking that of lamb in 1980 and that of beef in 1989.By 2004 it  had soared to almost 250 grams per person per week.

**Overall , the graph shows how the consumption of chicken increased dramatically while the popularity of these other foods decreased over the period.**

The diagrams show West Park School at three different stages in its development: 1950, 1980 and 2010.

In 1950, the school **was built** close to a main road and next to a number of houses. A large area behind the school **was turned into** a playground, <u>while</u> the area behind the houses was farmland.

By 1980, the houses had been **demolished** in order to **make way for** a small car park and an additional school building, which became the science block. In addition to the existing playground,the school also **gained** the farmland and **converted it into** a sports field.

In 2010, the school building **remained** unchanged <u>but</u> the car park was extended to cover the entire sports field. As a result of this, the original playground **was divided into** two so that it provided a smaller playground and a small sports field.

During this period, the school has increased in size and a car park has been created and enlarged. The combined recreational areas, however, first expanded and were then reduced in size.
